<h2>ACT ONE</h2>
<br>
<p class="hang3"><i>Breakfast-room at the Brauer residence. The back wall is
formed by three glass doors, separated by marble pillars. Behind this, the
veranda is visible, and balustrade, hung with fine rug, and stairs, leading into
the garden. The glass doors have practical, solid wooden shutters, with bars,
fastening inside. Doors R. and L. Large table C. with breakfast laid. Front, to
the left, sofa, table and easy-chair. To the right, sewing-machine, and basket
filled with table-linen. Old-fashioned photos and engravings on walls.
Otherwise, well-to-do family home.</i></p>

<p class="continue"><i>Time of day: Morning.</i></p>


<p class="right">[<span class="sc2">Gertrude
 </span><i>busy at breakfast-table</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Enters with </i><span class="sc2">Paul</span>, <i>from R</i>.]
Confound it! Everything seems to go wrong this morning!

<p class="right">[<i>Throws his cap on chair, angrily</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Happily</i>.] Good-morning, papa!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Morning, my child. Such carelessness! You ought to be ashamed
of yourself. If this thing had happened earlier in the season, out on the
meadows--but at this time of the year--!!! Oh! Confound it all, anyway!!!!! It
is inexcusable!!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">What is the matter, papa?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">The black cow has been overfed. But of course, when Marie is
not about to look after everything, things go to rack and ruin. Well, man, what
excuse are you going to make?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">None, Mr. Brauer.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Now that's the most sensible thing you have said this morning.
Here, take a cigar and get to work; but mind! send for the veterinary surgeon at
once. Have you had breakfast?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, sir!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then what the devil are you waiting for?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">I--I--I wanted to excuse myself, and----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Impatiently</i>.] It's all right! it's all right!</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Remains--hesitatingly</i>.] G--Good-morning!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">I--I have something else to tell you----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then out with it.</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">
[<i>With a glance at </i><span class="sc2">Gertrude</span>.] But----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">H'm! Gertrude, darling, will you please see if it is still
threatening rain?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, papa!<span style="letter-spacing:10px">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span> [<i>Goes
out on the veranda</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Confidentially</i>.] The old hag has turned up again.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Alarmed</i>.] Wha---- The devil you say! H'm! Who--who has
seen her?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">She was seen begging in the village--and last night, one of my
men observed her creeping stealthily around the sheds yonder.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Scratching his head</i>.] Yes, yes! I had almost
forgotten. She has served her last sentence--fully five years!--we have been
free from her annoying presence and now, she has returned. Well, what does she
want?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">She has heard her daughter is about to be married, she says.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Laughs</i>.] <i>Her</i> daughter? ha, ha! I see! no doubt
she has learned of Gertrude's betrothal. Well? and----</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">And so she has come to get her share of the wedding-cake--so
she says; but she dare not venture here.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, I should advise her to keep a respectful distance. Take
good care, Mr. Paul, that she approaches no one of this house. Do you hear? No
one. I will see the constable myself; and perhaps we'll soon get rid of her
again. Good-morning.</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">Good-morning, Mr. Brauer.<span style="letter-spacing:10px">&nbsp;
&nbsp;</span> [<i>Exit</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Enters</i>.] Shall I pour your coffee, papa?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">What? My little one looking after the breakfast, eh? Can you
do all that?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh papa! if I couldn't do even that----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">But Marie?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">
Oh, of course--not as well as she--you must have patience with me, papa!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why certainly, my pet! [<i>Embraces her</i>.] And now, let me
see--how many days are you left to me?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Only four more days, papa.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Now, you rascal! must you leave me? must you go and marry, eh?
must you?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">But papa, dear, it is all your own arrangement!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Of course, of course! what is a poor old man to do? Have you
seen George this morning? [<span class="sc2">Gertrude
 </span><i>shakes her head</i>.]
Such sloth! He does nothing but sleep, sleep, sleep.</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">He worked until very late last night, papa. At dawn this
morning I saw his light still burning; and then it was past three o'clock.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, I must admit, he is diligent and industrious--but also
stubborn--damned stubborn. [<i>The last is said almost to himself. Aloud</i>.]
Has mama been down?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, not yet.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">And Marie? has she returned?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">She arrived by the early morning train.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">And how nearly finished is the lover's nest, eh?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Only one more trip to the city, I believe she said.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, and do you like the arrangement?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">I don't know, papa dear. I am kept entirely in the dark. It is
to be a surprise to me. Oh, I will like it very much indeed, I think.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">And are you happy, my pet?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, papa, dear, I sometimes feel as if I didn't deserve all
this happiness.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, my dear, a housewife who calls these soft-boiled eggs,
certainly does not deserve such happiness.</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Embarrassed</i>.] I only boiled them about three-quarters
of an hour----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Ha, ha, ha, ha!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, I beg your pardon, papa, I will----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">There, there, I was only joking; never mind it. And Marie, I
suppose, is taking her rest now?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">If she only would do so. Papa, you must compel her to take a
rest. No one can endure such a strain. One day she is looking after this house,
and the next day she is in the city, furnishing our new home; and the nights she
passes on the train. I am sure she will break down.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, well, I will look after that.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Enters from L</i>.] Good-morning!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Morning! Well?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Throws her arms around her mother</i>.] Good-morning, mama
dear!</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Caressing her</i>.] My sweet! my pet! only four more
good-mornings, and then----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">You must come to visit me soon, mama!</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Crying</i>.] Visit? ah, yes!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">No tears now, no tears, I beg of you! Tears on an empty
stomach--b-r-r-r-r-r, that's poison.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">My darling, who dressed your hair last night?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">The housekeeper.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">There! I knew Marie could not have done that. But do you
know--Marie--a few moments ago I opened her door softly, to see how she was
resting, and found her still fully dressed, just as she came from the train,
seated at the open window, a book in her lap, and staring out into space.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, well, well! I thought her passion for novels had passed
away long ago.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">I've been thinking--we must watch her more closely.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">She needs no one to watch over her! She is well able to take
care of herself; but we must spare her----</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">But, Henry, just now--three days before the wedding--who could
think of sparing one's self?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, you know--h'm----</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Henry, you know how I love the girl; but, good gracious, she
is not our own dear, sweet one----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, she is more than that, mama dear.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">You are entirely too modest, my darling.</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, just imagine, mama dear, she was going to be
married--and I remained at home----</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then we would retain our sunshine, our consolation, our---- [<i>Looking
at breakfast table with a questioning expression</i>.] But, children, I can't
understand----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">What, mama dear?</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Gracious! Everything is so--so-- [<i>Topsy-turvy indicated by
action</i>.] If she is not going to sleep, she may as well come down here----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Laughingly caressing her mama</i>.] There, you see, mama,
dear, not even a single meal can you eat without her.</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="sc2">George von Harten </span><i>enters</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, at last you have aroused yourself; you----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Interrupts him, tapping his hand</i>.] There, softly,
softly, dear uncle; don't begin scolding so early in the morning.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Don't you think it's pretty near time to call me father, my
boy?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Not until after the wedding, dear uncle.--Good-morning,
auntie. [<i>Kissing her hand</i>.] Well, little one? [<i>Kissing her</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Leans on him lovingly</i>.] My George. [<i>Laughs suddenly</i>.]
Oh, just look! he is simply covered with hay!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then you may make yourself useful by brushing me off.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">The hayloft seems to be your favorite sleeping-place lately.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Sleep? Heavens! who could sleep in this weather? I roam about.
Lord knows where, over meadows and fields. Such St. John days!!! It's enough to
drive one mad. The days never seem to end. Late last night I was sitting in
front of my window. Said I to myself: &quot;No sleep for me to-night, until that
cursed nightingale runs out of melody&quot;--when suddenly a meadow-lark announces
the break of day--and there, it's morning. To the left, the twilight: to the
right, the dawn, peacefully together. From glow to glow a new day arises.
Children, I tell you, it was beautiful. Give me a cup of coffee.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">But, tell me! Are you going to remain here now?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why, certainly, until after the wedding.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">But the propriety of such a thing----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Imploringly</i>.] Oh, papa dear----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Its immaterial to me. Under no circumstances do I desire to
offend your sense of propriety; but then I will stay down at the inn, as the
nearest place.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">And in the morning you will bring us the house full of fleas.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">But, Henry----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, it's so.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">If you will allow me! The wedding was set for the twentieth;
therefore I obtained my first furlough from the nineteenth--and I trust you
realize that I can't change the dates to suit myself. I arrived on the
twentieth--and the wedding, of course--it was postponed.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">But, George dear, neither your home, nor anything else was
ready.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">And besides, where am I to go? My own home is broken up; Marie
has had everything torn up. By the way, has she returned?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Nods</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why, what's the matter? Have you two had another quarrel?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, certainly not; but I should not have allowed the girl to
make a drudge of herself for my sake. I almost wish I had remained at home.</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why, she is not doing all this for your sake, but for mine.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Now there, don't be conceited.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Caressing her</i>.] I think she has cause to be conceited.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">As my future wife, she certainly has cause to be that.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">There, there, don't you overrate yourself.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">I don't, dear uncle; I am too practical for that.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Very much indeed, thank you. I find the whole world beautiful;

doubly attractive, for here every one seems smiling and happy---- Pardon me.

<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Pastor, you will pardon this rudeness, she is still a child.</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, certainly, certainly; for she is right. I have not yet
been able to overcome my old tendency to play the gallant in the presence of
ladies--and in this frock--I know--I must look somewhat ridiculous.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Tell me. Pastor, how did you happen to obtain this position?</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, you see, that, too, is partly connected with this coat.
There were four of us, classmates--who, after graduating, were eagerly awaiting
the call to save the sinful world--and among them, myself the only one who was,
what you might say, in fairly good financial circumstances. We were now and then
compelled, first one and then the other, to present ourselves at the board of
directors--and as a consequence my coat suffered severely. Now it really never
fitted any one of my comrades and at my suggestion we finally purchased a coat,
that came nearer fitting each of us, striking a happy medium, as it were, to
every one's satisfaction. Then, about four weeks ago, an ex-fellow-student--the
curate of the cathedral--came to us, with this information: &quot;Ye holy men, list
ye to me. In yon Lithuanian mountains lives a minister of the gospel, who, on
account of his extreme age and feebleness, is incapacitated from properly
performing his duties. And as there are four of you, I propose that you draw
straws and leave it to chance who shall be the favored one.&quot; At that the others
unanimously declared: &quot;No, he who has shared with us his clothing shall be the
favored one&quot;--and--well, here I am and, I fear, not half as pious as I look.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Ah, courage, Pastor, courage----</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Pray do not think that I am ashamed of my calling; believe me,
like our Lord and Master, my heart aches for suffering humanity, and therefore
it has ever been my desire to follow in His footsteps. Besides, it was my
father's wish. You must know my father is a well-to-do farmer--there are no
really large estates in the lowlands--but he has considerable--yes, I might say,
a great deal of money--and owing to my early surroundings, I'm afraid I am much
better suited for a farmer than a minister of the gospel. But I will not give
up, and continue to struggle and rid myself of all my bad habits. Your health!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Do you know, Pastor, I am beginning to like you! Do you wish
to remain here and take the old pastor's place?</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">I really would like----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Very well, my vote you shall have!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">You are very kind, indeed. With such a position I should be
quite content, and to complete my happiness----but, by-the-bye, the object of my
visit was, really, the bridal-sermon. I am afraid our good old pastor will not
be able now----</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Ah----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Simultaneously</i>.] Will not be equal to the exertion,
you mean; ah--I feared as much.</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Therefore, if you will allow me--unless you desired some one
else----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Pastor, if we had not already heard you in the pulpit I would
deny your request, point blank, as you are practically a stranger to us. But
your ways and sentiments please me, and therefore--what say you, wife? [<i>She
nods</i>.]--And you, George?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, I don't know; but unless I am very much mistaken, there is
already a great deal of sympathy between us, eh, Pastor?</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Now I must confess that is rather meaningless, at least so far
as I am concerned; for my sympathy extends towards the whole world.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">At any rate I am glad----</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Jestingly</i>.] Then will you kindly leave us for awhile?
I desire to inquire into your past record.</p>

<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Now, then, with your kind permission, I will take a few
notes----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Certainly, Pastor!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">This young gentleman, your nephew, is especially close to the
family, is he not?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Correct!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Pardon me, but may I ask in what way?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">I will tell you. Pastor. It was in the year '67, when we had
here in East Prussia, a terrible drought--a year of distress and--do you
remember anything about it?</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Very little, as I was then still quite young.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Ah, it was terrible! Potatoes and fodder rotted before
ripening. Of wheat and rye hardly a trace. We farmers, I tell you--! Then it
was, when my brother-in-law, the husband of my sainted sister, whose estates
were in the neighboring township yonder, realized one day his financial ruin and
with all his aristocratic pride--you understand--he saw no other way--he
resorted to the pistol--he committed suicide.</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">And the--your sister, still lives?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Thank God, no! but from that day----</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Pardon the interruption; but I have heard your daughter, Miss
Marie, called &quot;the calamity child&quot; by some of the villagers. Has that any
connection with this year of distress?</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">And you didn't know that, Pastor--how she came into our house?
Well, during that same terrible winter, we were returning one night, my husband
and myself, from the town, where we had at our own expense erected a
soup-kitchen--when suddenly, at the corner of the woods yonder, where the road
makes a sharp turn, our horses shied--and there, in the middle of the road, we
saw lying, a woman, with a child pressed closely to her bosom. She refused to
stir and begged us to put her out of her misery. Of course, we took her into the
sleigh at once--ah, she was in an awful condition----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">I tell you, Pastor, it was months before we could rid the
blankets of vermin.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">And the child, the poor little thing----! But after being
bathed and fed, and lying there, between the clean white covers, we both stood
over its bed--the little thing, with its pinched face, laughed at us and
stretched out its tiny hands--my husband said to me: &quot;Wife, I believe this is
our share of all this sorrow and misery that heaven has sent us.&quot;</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">For you must know. Pastor, that our own daughter, Gertrude was
then not yet born.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, not until three years later. Well, we bought the child
from that miserable, drunken woman, in proper, legal form--determined and glad
to get rid of her, for she did smell so of gin, I could not endure it any
longer.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">That is what the worst drunkards in these parts prefer to
brandy.</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Unfortunately!!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">But to come back to my nephew----</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Pardon me, another question. What became of the mother?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Ah, that is a bad story--and just to-day----</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh--nothing, nothing. Anyway--that woman really did return,
and as we did not want the child to see her, we gave her more money. Of course
she remembered that and so finally she became a positive plague.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, Henry, I have often thought since, perhaps a mother's
heart prompted her----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">You think so, eh? Then perhaps a mother's heart also prompted
her to steal at the same time! for every time she honored us with a visit,
something or other disappeared, until I grew suspicious, had her watched, she
was caught red-handed--and, of course, a long term in prison was the result.</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">And the girl--does she know or suspect anything at all?</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">We told her, her mother was dead. But one day she really did
see her.</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">How did that misfortune happen?</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">It was on her confirmation day, just as the girls left the
church in a body, when we heard a cry. What had happened? Why, that woman had
been lying in wait for the procession; when suddenly she appeared, seized her
child, and kneeling before her in the road, passionately covered her hands and
feet with kisses.</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Shuddering</i>.] Horrible!!!!!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">I tore the child from her arms, of course, and carried her
into the house. We had to make some kind of an explanation; a drunken vagabond,
I told her! Did she believe it?--H'm?--Then she fell ill----</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">And how is it now?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Humorously</i>.] Why, Pastor, you seem very much
interested.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Enters</i>. <span class="sc2">Gertrude </span><i>follows him in</i>.] I presume I

<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">We haven't even started with your case. The pastor is

<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>With meaning and moved</i>.] You must not believe that,

<h3>Brauer.</h3>

will see him, as usual.</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, I had almost forgotten! He desires me to ask you kindly,
should you again favor him with eggnog, to please add a little more sugar, for
the last was a trifle tart.</p>

sweets, our sufferings are near the end. And now, adieu. Miss Marie, adieu.</p>

the furniture moved about; and then, I say to myself: &quot;Here is where they will
take their tea, and there they will while away their leisure hours&quot;--so---- But,
what I meant to tell you! Yesterday we had an accident--the large mirror in the

<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">It shall never be my fault, Marie.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Certainly never mine. But what I wanted to say,--I had the
large mahogany bookcase repolished. Is that satisfactory?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Anything you choose to do is satisfactory to me.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Hesitatingly</i>.] And then--I must tell you, George,
something important. When I unpacked the bookcase, I found a blue manuscript.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">[<i>Unsuspecting</i>.] What kind of a manuscript?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">George, you must not leave that lying around--not even hidden
behind the books, especially now, when you take your wife to your home.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">In heaven's name, what manuscript?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">I believe--it contains some poems----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">You believe--it contains some poems. I have missed it since
early last winter; I thought I had lost it. Marie, now tell me truthfully, have
you read its contents?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">N--no!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then why do you tell me not to leave it around?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, I read the first part, and had begun on the second, when
I concluded to go no further.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">And you really looked no further than the first? Absolutely no
further?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">No.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Can you swear to that?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">I can!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then swear!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">I swear! Are you satisfied?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, thank heaven! But you must not imagine for a moment that
the book contains anything I am ashamed of; on the contrary, I consider it so
sacred I would not have it desecrated by a stranger's eye. About four years ago,
something occurred within me--within my soul. No one knows--no one could even
guess, and no one shall ever know.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">No one? Not even I?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">
No, not even you. But where is the book? Give it to me!</p>

<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Turns up stage and takes it from her bosom</i>.] Here it

<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">If it's in my power, certainly!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then I must first confess to you. A few moments ago, when papa
questioned me, I deceived him. I was attacked last night--yes--but not by a man,
but by a woman--a Lithuanian woman. George, that woman was my mother!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">But I understood your mother was dead.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, no; that is not so. Not one of you ever told me the truth.
On the day of my confirmation I was waylaid by that very same woman--I cannot
have been mistaken.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Come, tell me, how did it happen?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">I was walking along quietly--'twas already dawning--when
suddenly a gaunt form arose from the ditch beside the road. I looked, and saw
before me a miserable beggarwoman, who called out to me in a trembling voice:
&quot;Marie--Madame--Daughter!&quot; I turned cold in fear and horror, and, unable to
utter one sound, I began to run; and I ran, ran, ran, and behind me I only heard
her agonizing call: &quot;My Marie--my daughter!&quot; And so, I ran away from my own
mother. And now, after a few hours' thought, I realize I did wrong. I must see
her and speak to her, and learn from her own lips who and what I am; and as papa
has forbidden me to leave this house--I would go in spite of him, but I have a
fear--I beg of you, George, dear, go to her, I implore you, find her for me--she
cannot be far away, and----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">And then?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then bring her to me, into the garden, or, better still, into
this room towards evening, when papa and mama are calling on the old pastor----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Marie, I cannot do that!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">The first time I ask a favor of you--and you say you cannot do
it?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Marie, dear, listen to me! You have been so kind to me of
late--and that has not always been so; but if you had sacrificed for me even
more than your own comfort and rest, I--I could not do it--I could not deceive
your father and mother, for I fear the consequences.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then can't you understand that, a foundling though I am, a
desire might come over me to see my own mother, though she be but a common
beggar and an outcast? That I might want to lay my head on her shoulder and be
petted and fondled, and cry myself to sleep on mine--on my own mother's breast?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Are you not fondled, are you not petted--has mama not always
been kind to you?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, but it is not the same--not the same. Never have I felt
the desire, the demand within me for my own flesh and blood, as just now.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">But why just now?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">[<i>Imploringly</i>.] Because my heart is bursting. Oh,

<p class="normal">I see you are working on Miss Gertrude's wedding outfit. How
beautiful, fit for a princess. But what I wanted to ask you: Madame has given me
the menu for the wedding feast, and as to fish, it calls for carp. Now you know
I am economical, but carp--common carp----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why, carp is a very fine fish----</p>
<br>
<h3>Katie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh yes, and good enough for--say--your wedding feast; but not
good enough for Miss Gertrude.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">For my wedding feast even carp is too good.</p>
<br>
<h3>Katie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh no; carp is not too good for you, though it may be good
enough--and do you know I will prepare a special Polish sauce--but Miss
Gertrude--she must have deep sea fish. Now will you see Madame about that,
please?</p>

<p class="normal">And he is going to ask for your hand!!! I always said you were
a lucky girl. Just think, you may be a St. John's-bride.</p>

<p class="normal">And what is a St. John's-bride?</p>
<br>
<h3>Katie.</h3>

<p class="normal"><i>You</i> don't know that, Miss Marie? Well, I'll tell you.
It is written in the new seal of Solomonis: &quot;Whoever shall give or receive their

quite some time ago. I wanted to accompany him, I begged and begged, but he
flatly refused to let me go.</p>

you--I have a growing fear, some other girl will take him away from me.</p>

that be possible?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Oh yes, you may laugh; but at times, when he looks at me, I
see a strange look come in his eyes. Half affection--half pity--and I don't want
to be pitied! Why should he? Am I not happy?</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Caressing her</i>.] Yes, dear; you ought to be very, very

<p class="normal">Oh, papa dear! The last time, the old pastor insisted upon
holding my hand in his so long; and they are so cold and clammy, so shriveled
and hairy, like the hands of the dead!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Come here, my child. Those hairy hands once christened you,
and at your confirmation the same shriveled hands were laid upon your head and
invoked for you the blessings of heaven; and would you, after all that, refuse
to hold them in your own warm young hands? My daughter, I do not wish to hear
that again. [<i>Kisses her</i>.]</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now, then, comes your turn,&quot; says the stork to the worm.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Looking after the girls, turns</i>.] I suppose so, but
take a care, uncle, I am not so easily digested.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">We shall see! We shall see!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">What do you want with me? My financial condition is
satisfactory. I have a good position, and my future is assured. I desire to
enjoy the results of my own labors, not those of yours.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">So, so!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, dear uncle. If you were so determined upon giving a large
dowry, you should have found another husband for Gertrude than myself.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Riled</i>.] Oh, hang you and your confounded pride!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, I am proud; and because of my pride and determination,
and, I may say, defiance, I have become what I am!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Rather arrogantly</i>.] And was there no diligence?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">That, also, was nothing but defiance.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">I almost believe you are determined to create another rumpus,
as you did twelve years ago.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">If necessary, yes!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">And was it necessary, even then?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">
You ask me that question? When one day I came here, during vacation from
college, you insisted upon my attending your church. I refused. You gave me my
choice, either to do as you asked, or have my allowance cut off. Then I resolved
in my mind never to comply with your command, in spite of everything. Oh, it is
no pleasure to hunger, as I was forced to do then; but you may believe me, as I
stand before you now, a free and independent man, I owe all of it to my stubborn
confidence in myself, looking neither to right nor left, but straight ahead,
without concessions, without falsehoods, always able to look every man straight
in the face. And this good conscience is my proudest possession. From it do I
draw all my strength, and I will never give it up.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, who the devil asked you to give it up?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">And one thing more. Of course, I belong to this house; fate
has made it my lot. Therefore it has ever been far from my mind to seek a wife
elsewhere, so strongly attached do I feel myself to this house; and that would
have been impossible, had I not from that day been a free man. And now, dear
uncle, you are at heart a good and kind man; but your hand is heavy, and it must
not lie upon me again as that of the master. For that reason do I refuse to
touch even one penny of the dowry, now or any other time.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">So, so! Then you are really afraid of me?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Afraid of you? Bah!!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">And at heart you are nothing but a coward!!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Uncle, I forbid you----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal"><i>You</i> forbid me? Ha! This is my house, and here I am the
master!</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="sc2">George </span><i>shrugs his shoulders</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, yes; it seems to annoy you to have any one keep an eye on
you and your conduct----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">My life has been as an open book to this day.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">But after to-day--what about that? Who can look into the
future? Who can look into your heart and read your thoughts? Who knows what may
happen over night, eh?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Uncle, these are insults I will not endure, even from you----</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Caressing him</i>.] Don't you mind him, George dear. After

<p class="normal">My child loves you. You are her ideal, her all, and the

might even say arrogance?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Must I perhaps ask your permission----?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">That is the same old defiance, the same unreasonable
stubbornness of your father's!!!!!</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">[<i>Starts</i>.] My father has been dead these twenty
years--what do you want of him now?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">What do I want of him? That he left you to me, to bring up
from childhood, I will hardly mention; although that ought to be sufficient to
temper your untamable pride--at least towards me; but----</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Uncle, you may abuse me as much as you please, but my father I
will not have disturbed! My father--you shall let him rest in peace!</p>

could rest in peace?</p>

<br>

<p class="normal">Well then, who was it, when he laid there, dead, before us,
who paid his debts of honor and saved your father's name from disgrace?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Pause</i>.]</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Uncle, you should not have said that!</p>

<p class="normal">You should not have said that, uncle! No, no----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">My God, you knew of it?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, I knew of it, and yet you should not have said it; you
should not have repeated it. Twelve years ago, in our quarrel, when you raised
your whip to me--and I reached for the carving-knife--no, no--I should not have
done that. You should not have raised your whip, nor I the knife. That is the
reason I refused anything from you at all. Now you know it. From that day I
swore to scratch the gold from the ground with my finger nails and fling it in
your face. From that day I hated you--and rightly so!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">And all that because I saved your and your father's name from
dishonor and disgrace?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal"><i>No!</i> But because you turned that same deed into a weapon
to crush my youthful pride.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">My boy, one uses the weapon nearest to hand.</p>

<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Bitterly</i>.] Even if it is only a whip. But then, I see
my mistake. I have no right to pride; my fatherly inheritance does not permit
it. Give me your gold! I'll take it! All--all!</p>

<p class="normal">No, no; in your present state of mind I will force nothing on
you. You might again turn to hating me.</p>

<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">And we will ever remember this day--the day that brought us

<p class="normal">Don't, George! Go away! Please don't!</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Embarrassed</i>.] But why should I suddenly go away,
Marie?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Go, George, I beg of you! I must lay the table!! Now go!</p>

<p class="normal">Marie, you said yourself you had no one but me!</p>

<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Now, then, tell Marie to bring the bowl!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Ah! you are going to have a bowl?</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why, of course, Pastor. This is St. John's Eve. The villagers
will set off tar-barrels and bonfires, and we will celebrate it with a bowl.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Mischievously</i>.] But perhaps this festival is too
heathenish for the clergy----</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Bless you, that all depends. If you have not the clergy's
sanction, then it is wicked and heathenish----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">But if they are invited, then it is Christianly and good? Ha,
ha----!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, I did not say that. You had better apply to the
consistory, they are better able to decide that point.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Ah, Pastor, you are a diplomat. Well, what are you two doing
over there? You are not saying a word.</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">George is too lazy. He is drawing little men, and I am
writing.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">In his place I think I would prefer to draw little women. Eh,
Pastor?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Just as you say, uncle!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Aside</i>.] What the devil is the matter with him to-day?
Come, children, be jolly, this is St. John's Eve! Ah, here is the punch! Now,
then, Gertrude, lend a hand!</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, papa.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Drinks</i>.] Excellent, Marie! Superb! I tell you, Pastor,
whoever gets her for a wife will be a lucky man indeed.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Oppressed</i>.] They will soon set off the bonfires.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">See, see--at last you have spoken; I feared you had lost your
tongue. Come here, my child. Get your glasses, all of you---- Your health! The
Pastor shall give us a toast; yes, yes, Pastor!--a genuine pagan toast, well
suited to this night! Now, tell me, my child, are you obliged to go to the city
again to-night?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, papa dear.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">But if I will not allow it?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">You gave your permission quite two weeks ago, papa dear!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">But not to go in the middle of the night!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">I must go, papa. The men are to be there at seven in the
morning, and if I am not there to give instructions the house will never be
finished in time.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Never mind, Henry, there is no help for it.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">But look at her!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why, papa, there is nothing the matter with me. I am well and
merry----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">You are merry, eh? Let me hear you laugh!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Tries to laugh</i>.] Ha, ha, ha----!</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">[<i>Imitating her</i>.] Yes, yes--ha, ha, ha----!</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Come here, my child. [<i>Strokes her hair</i>.] Did you sleep
well last night?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, mama.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">But if this stranger should attack you again?</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Pardon me, but what do I hear?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, nothing of importance, Pastor. [<i>To </i><span class="sc2">
Marie</span>.] You will take the one o'clock train----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, papa.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">There is another--at four--t'will be daylight then----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">But I would not reach the city in time.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Very well, you needn't go to bed, then. George can take you to
the depot.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Startled</i>.] George?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Startled and simultaneously</i>.] What--I?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Certainly! Why not?</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Pray do not think me obtrusive; but I am at your service.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, no, thank you. Pastor; your time will come some other day.
[<i>Aside</i>.] It will at least give him something to do. [<i>Meaning</i>
George.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">I want to go too, papa! I love moonshine promenades.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, no, my pet. In the first place, it is very improper for
lovers to be out so late at night, without a chaperon.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">I would much prefer to go alone. I am not at all afraid--and I
do not wish to trouble George--or any one else----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Any one else is out of the question, for in this house every
one rises at five in the morning. [<i>To </i><span class="sc2">George</span>.]
Now, then, what excuse have you to offer?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Excuse? I? Why, none at all, except that she does not want me
to go. You heard it yourself!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Have you two been quarreling again?</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Don't insist, Henry, if they don't want to----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">By the way, send for Mr. Paul--I wish to speak to him. Pastor,
your health! [<i>Drinks</i>.]</p>

<p class="hang2">[<i>At this </i><span class="sc2">Marie </span><i>and </i><span class="sc2">

<h3>Voice.</h3>
<br>
<p class="normal">Mr. Paul! Mr. Paul!</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>From behind scene</i>.] I am coming in one moment! [<i>Short
pause. He enters</i>.] Here I am!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Ah, there you are! Give him a glass of punch!</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">Thank you, I have just had a glass of beer.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Very well! Now, don't let us disturb you, children! Pastor,
this is the time to prepare your toast. [<i>Aside to </i><span class="sc2">Paul</span>.]
Well, have you learned anything of this stranger?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">Not a sign of one, excepting two tramps at the inn, the
gendarme placed under arrest; but that was the day before yesterday.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">H'm! If I had ever had the slightest reason to doubt her
word---- Marie, my child, come here to me.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, papa!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Looks at her sharply</i>.] Never mind, now.</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Aside to </i><span class="sc2">Brauer</span>.] By the
way, I saw the old woman again!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Sh! not so loud! Where?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">She had money, too----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">I wonder where she stole it?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">I wonder! The innkeeper said she had a gold piece. But don't
you worry, Mr. Brauer. She will soon give us cause to have her locked up again.
She is incorrigible!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Does she sleep at the inn?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, sir! At night she leaves there, only to reappear in the
morning.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">H'm! that would almost be sufficient reason---- George!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Uncle?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">I have changed my mind. You must accompany Marie!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Just as you say, uncle!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">And no quarreling this time, Marie!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, papa.</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>On the veranda</i>.] There, there, look! The first
bonfire!!</p>

<p class="hang2">[<i>Singing and laughter is heard in distance. A red glow is
seen</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Have you taken care, Mr. Paul, to keep them far enough away
from the sheds?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, Mrs. Brauer!</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">For you must know. Pastor, last year the sparks came very near
setting fire to the straw roofs.</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">There is a second one now, and there on the hill, another.
See, George, see! How beautiful!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, yes, darling, I see!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Pulls him forward softly</i>.] Why do you call me darling
to-day?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, shan't I?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, of course; but do you love me more to-day?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">I love you always, my pet!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Softly and with emotion</i>.] But you usually call me
&quot;little one,&quot; and to-day nothing but &quot;darling.&quot;</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Now, then, Pastor, we are ready for the toast! Take up your
glass, and fire away!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">I am afraid it will be hardly as wicked and heathenish as you
seem to expect.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Come, come, Pastor, don't keep us waiting!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, what shall I say? I am not going to preach you a sermon!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, no, Pastor; we are content to wait for that till Sunday.</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, then, you see, on a beautiful and dreamy night like
this--may I say dreamy?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">You may, Pastor, you may!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">For we all dream at times, more or less, both young and old!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Ah, yes! that is a failing we all have!!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">On such a dreamy night, different emotions are aroused within
us. We seem to be able to look into the future, and imagine ourselves able to
fathom all mystery and heal all wounds. The common becomes elevated, our wishes
become fate; and now we ask ourselves: What is it that causes all this within
us--all these desires and wishes? It is <i>love</i>, brotherly love, that has
been planted in our souls, that fills our lives; and, it is life itself. Am I
not right? And now, with one bound, I will come to the point. In the revelation
you will find: &quot;God is love.&quot; Yes, God is love; and that is the most beautiful
trait of our religion--that the best, the most beautiful within us, has been
granted us by <i>Him</i> above. Then how could I, this very evening, so overcome
with feeling for my fellow-man--how could I pass <i>Him</i> by? Therefore, Mr.
Brauer, no matter, whether pastor or layman, I must confess my inability to
grant your wish, and decline to give you a genuine pagan toast----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Grasps his hand</i>.] That was well spoken, Pastor! Pardon
me, I was only jesting!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, no, dear uncle, not altogether. There I must defend you
against yourself. A devout and pious man like yourself, t'was not entire
wantonness, your desire to hear something other than religious, and since the
Pastor has so eloquently withdrawn, I will give you a toast. For, you see, my
dear Pastor, something of the old pagan, a spark of heathenism, is still glowing
somewhere within us all. It has outlived century after century, from the time of
the old Teutons. Once every year that spark is fanned into flame--it flames up
high, and then it is called &quot;The Fires of St. John.&quot; Once every year we have
&quot;free night.&quot; Then the witches ride upon their brooms--the same brooms with
which their witchcraft was once driven out of them--with scornful laughter the
wild hordes sweep across the tree-tops, up, up, high upon the Blocksberg! Then
it is, when in our hearts awake those wild desires which our fates could not
fulfill--and, understand me well, dared not fulfill--then, no matter what may be
the name of the law that governs the world on that day, in order that that one
single wish may become a reality, by whose grace we prolong our miserable
existence, thousand others must miserably perish. Part because they were never
attainable; but the others, yes, the others, because we allowed them to escape
us like wild birds, which, though already in our hands, but too listless to
profit by opportunity, we failed to grasp at the right moment. But no matter.
Once every year we have &quot;free night.&quot; And yonder tongues of fire shooting up
towards the heavens--do you know what they are? They are the spirits of our dead
and perished wishes! That is the red plumage of our birds of paradise we might
have petted and nursed through our entire lives, but have escaped us! That is
the old chaos, the heathenism within us; and though we be happy in sunshine and
according to law, to-night is St. John's night. To its ancient pagan fires I
empty this glass. To-night they shall burn and flame up high--high--and again
high! Will no one drink to my toast?</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Pause</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Trembling</i>.] I will!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>They look into each other's eyes and clink glasses</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Hesitatingly</i>.] I, too, George!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Stroking her hair sadly, patronizing</i>.] Yes, yes; you,
too.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Suddenly bursting out</i>.] You--you idiots! What do you
know about it, anyway? I--I didn't understand it myself, but I have a
presentiment there is something sinful about it all!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">My dear Mr. von Harten, above all your heathenism watches our
good old God, our Father, and therefore I fearlessly drink to your toast.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, well, I'll not be the only exception. [<i>Drinks also. A
glow much nearer, behind the trees. Louder yelling and laughter</i>.] Well, what
is it now?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">They are dangerously near the sheds now.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Didn't I tell you to take the proper precautions?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">I did. They had only three tar-barrels early this evening.
Where they got the fourth from, I don't know.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">I'll wager they found the barrel of axle-grease! Why didn't
you lock it up?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">You know yourself, on this day no lock or key is of any avail.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Don't talk nonsense, but see what's to be done. I will be
there myself, presently. Be quick! [<span class="sc2">Paul </span><i>exits</i>.] I can't depend on
anybody these days! Where is my hat? [<span class="sc2">Marie </span><i>gets it</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Can't we go, too, papa?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Will you come, wife?</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, gladly, but stop scolding. There isn't a breath of air
stirring, and therefore no danger.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Come along, Pastor!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit </i><span class="sc2">Brauer</span>, <span class="sc2">George</span>, <span class="sc2">Gertrude </span><i>

<p class="normal">Won't you accompany us, Miss Marie?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, thank you, Pastor!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then may I remain with you for a while?</p>
<br>
<h3>Several Voices.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Outside, calling</i>.] Pastor, Pastor!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Speaks through door</i>.] I will be with you in a moment!
[<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Marie</span>.] Well, may I!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why, certainly, if it gives you pleasure!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Pleasure is hardly the proper word. I wanted to thank you for
insisting upon my writing the bridal-poem. It has been a work of pleasure, I
assure you. Do you like it?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">It is very nice. Pastor!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Have you memorized it already?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">I think so!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then would you mind reciting it for me? Come, I will assist
you: &quot;The flowers, the beautiful blossoms&quot;---- Well?---- &quot;are a maiden's----&quot;</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, Pastor!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">You are acting so strangely to-day! You are so shy--so----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">The St. John's night oppresses me!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">That will soon be over.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Would that it were over now!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Perhaps the thought of traveling alone at night has something
to do with it?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh! [<i>Recovering herself--lightly</i>.] You are right,
Pastor; but it can't be helped!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Shall I come with you? Oh, I'll find something to be done in
the city. I won't even have to ask permission. Anyway, I am longing for a
glimpse of the good old town. I will inform the old pastor--I don't think he has
retired as yet----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then please tell him---- I usually visit him myself every day,
but now, just before the wedding, it's impossible for me to call. Will you
please tell him that? I am so fond of him! Tell him that, and in thought I kiss
his hand.</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Certainly. And may I accompany you!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, thank you. Pastor!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Now let us speak openly, Miss Marie. I have been watching you
all the evening. You appear to me--what shall I call it--like a mouse before a
cat! You need a protector; some one in whom you can confide, some one----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">And so you would like to be my father confessor! Eh, Pastor?</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">You know very well we do not have that institution in the
Protestant Church, though at times it might prove a blessing----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Mischievously</i>.] And then again it might not?</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">You are quite right. We should all rely more upon
ourselves----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>With emphasis</i>.] I do that, Pastor, I do!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, my dear Marie--pardon me, I should not have said
that--and yet I must speak frankly with you; you seem to have a fear--a
dread----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Of the cat?</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">I wish I knew!!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">But supposing I were the cat, who would then be the mouse?</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">That would be sinful and wicked in you!!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">But one cannot be the cat and the mouse at the same time?</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, one can! But he who does, plays with his own destruction!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">And if one destroys one's self, who cares?</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">You should not talk like that, Miss Marie.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, it is all nonsense, all nonsense, for to-night is St.
John's night. Do you see that fire yonder. Pastor? They had to put it out! But
there, on the hill--look, there, there! How beautiful! How wild!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, and when you look closely, it is nothing more than a mass
of dirty lumber.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">For shame, Pastor!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Like everything that blazes, except the sun----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">You should not have said that, Pastor--you should not. I don't
want it! I will not have you slander my St. John's fires! I want to enjoy it
once--only once--then nevermore!!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Disturbed</i>.] My dear Miss Marie, I do not understand

now and for all time to come. Marie, I don't know how to express myself; but I
desire to shield and protect you all your life--I will worship you----</p>

<p class="normal">Pastor, do you know who and what I am?</p>

<p class="normal">Pastor, how am I to understand this?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Marie, I know I should not have spoken, at least not now. I
should have waited--it was stupid of me, I know; but I have such a fear--a fear
for you. You are going to the city to-night and I don't know what may happen!
But you shall know before you go, where you belong and that your future is
assured!</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>With a sigh of relief--almost a sob</i>.] Ah--ah--ah----!</p>

<p class="normal">Marie, I do not want an answer now. Besides, I must first

<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, we two have not been very intimate--I only thought----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">So, then, we have both our burden; and we soon will have to
part. Therefore we can now safely speak of the past. My manuscript you read! You
even went so far as to perjure yourself on account of it. Oh, you don't mind a
little thing like that! I wish I were the same! You know the subject of my
verses, and we must now understand each other fully. Now, tell me openly, why,
why did you treat me so unkindly, to say nothing worse, in former days?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Did I, George?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">'Tis hardly necessary to remind you of all the indignities you
heaped upon me. It almost seemed to me as if you purposely intended to drive me
mad. Do you remember the day when I followed you into the cellar, and you turned
and ran out and locked the door, and compelled me to remain there all night?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Smiling</i>.] Yes, I remember!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why did you do that?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">That is very simple. You are Count von Harten--and I?--I am
but a poor Lithuanian foundling--aye, worse than that. If you follow such a one
into the cellar, she knows, or at least thinks she knows, your purpose.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">So, that was the reason! And at the same time you went under
your manzanillo-tree to die?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Nods</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">And did you never realize the real state of things? Gertrude
was then still a child--and because I could not win you, I took her. Did that
thought never occur to you?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">How could I ever dare to think that?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">But later?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">The day before yesterday, when I read your book, I felt it for
the first time.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">And now, it is too late----</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Yes, now it is too late! Had I felt then as I do now, I would
not have resisted you----</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Marie, do you know what you are saying?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Breaking out</i>.] Oh I don't care, I don't care! It is my
fate. You must rule and govern--and I--I must serve; and in the end--we both

<p class="normal">Marie, you should be loved, you must be loved--beyond all
senses--loved beyond all measure!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Pointing towards R</i>.] He loves me!</p>

<p class="normal">Don't be angry, George dear; you don't dare love me yourself.
You can never be anything to me!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, never; for this house must be kept clean. No, no, this
house must not be soiled. We would both suffocate in our shame. But we can think
of what might have been; that is not sin, is it?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">What were your words? &quot;They are the wild birds of paradise,
that have escaped us.&quot; That was it, was it not? How beautiful!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">I don't remember!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">But I am not a wild bird, George; I am tame--so tame----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">You are tame?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">The poor thing! But you will love her?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">As well as possible! But then I must not think of you.</p>

<p class="normal">But you must not think of me--and I will try and not think of
you!</p>

<p class="normal">Never, Marie?</p>

<p class="normal">Only occasionally--on holidays----</p>

<p class="normal">Only then?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">And on St. John's eve----</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">When the fires are burning?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, and when the fires are out, then I shall cry----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Marie!!!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, no, George, sit still--I will sit here. Some one might be
in the garden, after all.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">They are all sound asleep!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Even so! We must be brave; not for mine--but for your sake,
George.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why did you say that? What do you think of me?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">I think you are hard-hearted.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">And yet you love me?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, I love you, for your own sake. For you have had to
struggle and fight--and that is what made you what you are. I have also fought
and struggled; but I have lost faith in myself--lost faith in everything. If you
only knew!! Sometimes I am afraid of myself--sometimes I would commit murder, so
restless and without peace I am.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">With me you would have found peace. We would have worked
together and planned through half the nights--and you know how ambitious I am.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">And so am I, for you! You should be the first and greatest.
They all shall bow before you--I myself will kneel before you and say to you:
&quot;You love to rule and command? Now rule--now command!!!!!!&quot;</p>

<br>
<h3>Katie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Mrs. Brauer, I would like to speak to you a moment.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Wiping her eyes</i>.] What is it, Katie?</p>
<br>
<h3>Katie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Sniveling</i>.] Oh, I'm so happy----</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Church bells are heard softly in the distance</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">There go the church bells. Have you put plenty of wine and
luncheon in the arbor?</p>
<br>
<h3>Katie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, ma'am! Miss Marie and I have prepared a lot!</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">What did you want to see me about?</p>
<br>
<h3>Katie.</h3>

<p class="normal">I wanted to ask you about the roast; shall we put it in the
oven now, and just warm it up for dinner? Miss Marie thinks----</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Never mind! I'll be down in the kitchen in a moment!</p>
<br>
<h3>Katie.</h3>

<p class="normal">And another thing, Mrs. Brauer; won't you please try and get
Miss Marie to take a little rest? She has been hard at work since two o'clock
this morning, and all day yesterday she was in the city. She can't stand it.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, on a day like this, we must all put our shoulders to the
wheel.</p>
<br>
<h3>Katie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Ah, Mrs. Brauer, you and I are old, and not much good for
anything but work; but we must spare our young people. Why, at times she almost
gives out.</p>
<br>
<h3>Mrs. Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, I will come and see for myself.</p>
<br>
<h3>Katie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Thank you!!! Oh, such a day!!! I am so happy---- [<i>Exit both
L</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Enters with </i><span class="sc2">George </span><i>and </i><span class="sc2">
Gertrude</span>.] Thank goodness, that's over. Let me see: first it was the old
soldiers, then the Turners, and now the Singing Society---- But do you know, I
am so sick of all this wine--give me a brandy.</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Gets drink from sideboard</i>.] Yes, papa!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>To </i><span class="sc2">George</span>.] And what's the
matter with you?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>With a sigh</i>.] Nothing!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Imitating him</i>.] Nothing!!! I can't quite make you
out---- Here, have a drink?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, thank you!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, then, don't! Your health, my pet!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Drink hearty, papa!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Rises</i>.] The carriage will arrive here sharply at ten!
Understand?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">And your friend from the city--we will find him at the
station?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes; he arrives quarter to ten.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">For we must have two witnesses.--Do you know what I would
like? [<i>Tapping him on breast</i>.] I would like to be able to look in there.</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, let him alone, papa! He is now my George. If I am
satisfied with him----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">You are right! He who gets my child can laugh--but he also
shall laugh. Understand?<span style="letter-spacing:3px">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span> [<i>Exit
R</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Never mind him, George dear. You need not laugh if you don't
want to. Not on my account. [<i>Bells</i>.] Do you hear, George? The church
bells, ringing softly, singing, like human voices!!!! That is for you and me!!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why for us?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">It is the old pastor's desire; half an hour this morning, and
then again this afternoon, when we exchange rings. Do you know, George, mama
says a bride's dream the night before her wedding is surely an omen. Do you
believe that?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Preoccupied</i>.] Yes.</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">I dreamed last night of a large, yellow wheat-field, in which
a poor little rabbit had hidden itself; and high above, in the air, I saw a
large hawk. Then it appeared to me that I was the little rabbit, and in fear and
dread I called out &quot;George! George!&quot; when suddenly it shot down upon me!--just
think----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">And then?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then I awoke. The cold perspiration stood thickly upon my
brow---- Oh, George dear, you will protect me? You won't let any one hurt me,
will you? For I am only a poor little rabbit, after all----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Staring before him</i>.] My God!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">George, I wanted to ask you something.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">You don't love some one else, do you?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Disturbed</i>.] But, my child----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, you know that if a bride cannot laugh on her wedding
day, she loves another----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why, nonsense----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Unshaken</i>.] Oh, yes, George; I read it myself. And even
if you do, George, I feel so--my love for you is so great, it could move
mountains. I love you so dearly---- She will surely learn to forget you, I will
love you so much.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">But, my pet----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, no, George. You see, I don't blame you so much. How could
I? For what am I, compared to other women?--George, does she love you so very
much?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Who?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">
Oh, you know. But don't worry, George dear; she will forget you in time! Don't
you remember Robert, our neighbor's son? He threatened to kill himself if I
didn't marry him, and he has already forgotten me! And to-day, when we stand at
the altar, at the Doxology and the exchange of rings, I will nudge you softly,
and then we will both pray to our good Father in heaven to make it easy for her;
for no one shall be unhappy on this day! Why, George, you are crying!!!!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Crying--I?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why, yes! Here are two large tears running down your cheek. [<i>Wipes
his eyes with her handkerchief</i>.] So there----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Tell me, my pet; and if we should be parted, after all?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">How could that be possible?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">If I should die--or----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Embracing him</i>.] No, no! Don't say that! Don't say
that!!!</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="sc2">Marie </span><i>appears in door, seeing
embrace</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Startled</i>.] Some one is here----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">It is only Marie.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Pointedly</i>.] You seem to be particularly affectionate
to-day.</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Miffed</i>.] We always love each other. Oh, perhaps that
doesn't please you----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">It is nothing to me!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Half Jesting</i>.] Besides, what do you want here? Isn't
there anything to do in the kitchen?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Stung, but controlling herself</i>.] Mama has sent me----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, yes, dear; you are just in time to dress my hair. Have
you hairpins?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Shaking her head</i>.] I will get some. [<i>Reels</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Affectionately</i>.] What's the matter, dear? Oh, you must
be tired!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">I am not tired.</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, yes, you are. Now you sit down here. I will fetch them
myself. [<i>Quick exit</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Full of fear</i>.] Gertrude!!!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">I must speak with you!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Speak; I am listening.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Why this tone? Does it perhaps mean that between us all is
over?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">If it is or is not, it matters little.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Am I, then, to understand----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">My God! Have you not Gertrude? But now I saw her in your arms!
What do you want with me?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">I must speak with you----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Not now----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Re-enters</i>.] Here are the hairpins. [<span class="sc2">Marie </span><i>
takes them</i>.] I have also brought my dressing-sacque and combs. Now we will
excuse you for a little while, George dear. You can give your judgment later.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>With a glance at </i><span class="sc2">Marie</span>.] May I
not remain?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, no. You would criticise and find fault, and embarrass
Marie, and me, too. Now be good, George, and go into the garden. [<span class="sc2">George </span><i>
exits</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Holding sacque</i>.] Will you put this on?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, I will put it around me.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">As you please. How do you want your hair dressed, high or low?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">But Marie, we had decided upon that! Have you forgotten?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, pardon me--I--of course we had!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then give me a kiss!</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="sc2">Marie </span><i>suddenly takes her head in
both hands and stares at her</i>.]</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">[<i>Frightened</i>.] Why do you look at me so strangely?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">[<i>Embraces her fiercely</i>] My darling!!!!</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Oh, you hurt me!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Perhaps you hurt me, too----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">I? How so?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Has begun to comb</i>.] How can you ask? You are about to
be married--and--and--I--I am jealous of you!</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Just wait, Marie, dear. [<i>Sings</i>.]</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In a year, in a year, when the nightingale comes----&quot;</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Intensely</i>.] When the nightingale comes?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">You will be Pastor's wife. [<i>Laughs</i>.]</p>

loudly and forced</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>In pain</i>.] Oh, you are pulling my hair----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Any one as happy as you should be able to bear a little pain.
There! I will braid it into your hair--for you are happy, are you not? Very
happy?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes! I am--that is--I would like to be--but George--he is so
sad.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal"><i>George</i>?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Lurkingly</i>.] Perhaps you were right! Perhaps he <i>does</i>
love another!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Softly groaning</i>.] Oh, why did you say that?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Because---- No, no--how could he? That was wicked in me,
wasn't it? How could he think of another, when he looks at you?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, no, Marie, you are right! I told him so myself!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Slowly and marked</i>.] And what did he say?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">He?--He said nothing! And then--he cried----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Triumphantly</i>.] He cried? George cried? Have you ever
seen him do that before?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, never!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>To herself</i>.] He cried----</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">And then he said: &quot;What if we should be parted, after all?&quot;</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">If who should be parted--you and he?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes--if he should die----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">If he--oh, that is what he meant! Oh, well, he just wanted to
say something. [<i>With forced lightness</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Of course he did. But what about the other woman? Oh, I didn't
let him see that I cared--and for the time I didn't care, really; but now, when
I think of it! My God!--if it were really so! If I only knew!!!!!!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Of course, he would not tell you!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Do you think he would tell any one else?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, sooner than tell you.</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes! I suppose so!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Shall I ask him?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, if you would do that for me----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">There now, it is done. Here is the comb and the rest of the
hairpins. Now go!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">And do you really think he would tell you?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">I am sure he will.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Oh, Marie, how grateful I shall be to you----</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Pushes her out of the door</i>.] Go now, go! [<i>Stretches

<p class="normal">No, Mr. Paul!</p>

<p class="normal">What shall I say, Pastor?</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Are you not happy this day?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Hard</i>.] No!</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Not even on account of our betrothal?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">We will have no betrothal, Pastor!</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">What are you saying?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">I shall leave this place----</p>
<br>

<p class="normal"><i>You</i>----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">To-day, I leave this house!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Pardon me, if I have forced my attentions upon you----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">No! You have not!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">My attentions were honorable, I assure you----</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Thank you, Pastor, I know that; but----</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then it is not on my account you are leaving?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Certainly not!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Does any one here know of your intention?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">No one!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Miss Marie, I am still a young man; if I should mention such a
word as &quot;life's happiness,&quot; it would, perhaps, sound absurd. Therefore, I will
not speak of myself. My fate is in my own hands. But if you realize this moment
what you owe to this house--and I say this not for mine, nor for their sake, I
say it for yours and yours alone; though I am but a poor mortal--it pains
me--but be that as it may--Marie, if you cause a discord in this house, the
blame will rest upon yourself.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Perhaps!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Pardon me--I will not question you. I wish to know nothing;
that, in the end, is always the best. Did I not love you as well as myself, I
would not speak another word; but as matters stand now, I will say one--aye, one
more word--I would not have dared to say otherwise. The greatest, the highest
thing one possesses in this world, is his life's
<i>melody</i>--a certain strain that ever vibrates, that his soul forever
sings--waking or dreaming, loudly or softly, internally or externally. Others
may say: &quot;His temperament or his character is so, or so.&quot; He only smiles, for he
knows his melody and he knows it alone. You see, Miss Marie, my life's happiness
you have destroyed, but my life's melody you can not take from me. That is pure
and will always remain so. And now I say to you, Miss Marie, if you fill this
house, where you have obtained everything you possess--honor, bread, and
love--if you fill this house with sorrow--if you dare to sin against your father
and your mother----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">One moment, Pastor. My father and my mother--what do you know
about them? My father I don't know myself, but my mother? Ah yes, I know her
well; and from her I have inherited my life's melody. This melody has a
beautiful text. Do you want to know what it is, Pastor? It is, &quot;<i>Thou shalt
steal</i>. Steal everything for thyself--thy life's happiness--thy
love--all--all. Only others will enjoy it in the end.&quot; Yes, Pastor, my mother is
a thief. On St. John's eve she came stealthily over yonder garden hedge; and as
my mother, so am I! And now, Pastor, ask me no more; I need all my senses, for
to-day my entire happiness is at stake! There--now you know all!</p>
<br>
<h3>Pastor.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, now I know! Farewell, Miss Marie. I will forget this day,
perhaps;
<i>you</i>--never----</p>

<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Were you at that door, listening?</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal"><i>Marie</i>!--For shame!!!!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Now go and dress yourself; I will call George. Go now, go!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gertrude.</h3>

<p class="normal">And will you come and tell me at once?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">At once! Yes!! [<span class="sc2">Gertrude

[<span class="sc2">Marie </span><i>calling softly</i>.] George! George!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Enters from veranda</i>.] Are you alone?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">[<i>Nods</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Have you arranged it so?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">You wished to speak to me, so I have arranged it!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Marie, I wished to tell you. One hour more I am a free
man--and my mind is made up. It is yet time to change our fates. What will you
answer me?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Answer you? Why, I don't know what you want.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">You know it well enough. I want <i>you</i>! Do you hear me? <i>
You</i>, who belong to me for life--I want you!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Softly--happily</i>.] I thought the fires were out--and
you had forgotten me--and now you want me?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Softly</i>.] Are you not mine? Are you not my wife in the
eyes of heaven?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, but in the eyes of the world it is <i>Gertrude</i>!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Must it, then, be so?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Doubtingly</i>.] Go--go--you love her----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, I do love her. How could I help that? Do you not also
love her?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Bitterly</i>.] Ah, I don't know. A few moments ago, when I
saw her in your arms--and you wept, too--only, because you love her!! Oh, but I
can bear it!! I will bear it like--like--ah!---- But there--that is no one's
affair but mine----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">So, so, that is no one's affair but yours, eh? You might have
invented a sweeter torture. I meant to remain an honorable man all my life; if
unable--well, there are plenty of bullets left.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">And do you wish to die?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">I do not want to, I must!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal"><i>George</i>, then take me with you? [<i>He shakes his head</i>.]
For years I have carried the wish in my heart--to kill you! Then I would kiss
and love you like mad--and then follow you into eternity----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Nonsense, girl, nonsense! Can't you see, how one turns round
and round and round in a circle, till at last to find no other escape than
death?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">I am not afraid to die; though with you, I'd rather live----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">To live, dear, will require more courage for both of us.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">How so?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Can you ask? Here in this house, to which we owe
everything--both you and I? Where they gave us food, shelter and love? After all
that, would you have the courage to destroy their happiness?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">The good old pastor used to say: &quot;You must have the courage to
do everything, except to do wrong.&quot; I would even have the courage to do wrong.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Shall I put you to the test?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">If you will give me your hand now and say to me: &quot;Come, we
will run away, through yonder garden gate--just as we are--now, this very
moment&quot;--you shall see how I will run!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">What?--Secretly--without telling any one? Is that what you
mean?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Don't you?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Laughs bitterly</i>.] No, no!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, what then?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Face to face, like a man. There he stands--I here. If he will
give me back my word, 'tis well. If he refuses [<i>determined</i>], 'tis also
well.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">My God! You know his temper! He will kill us--he will kill us
both!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">'Tis death either way----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">George--think----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, I have thought of it for two days and two nights. One is
madness and the other insanity. There is no other way. [<i>Pained</i>.] Only the
thought of the child gives me pain----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">
Of course, if your feelings for Gertrude----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then it is your desire? [<i>She nods assent</i>.] Very well!
So be it! But remember, it is a question of life and death!--And, therefore, you
yourself must be present.</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>In terror</i>.] I?--I be present when you ask him?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">What?--You, who wish to become my helpmate and partner in
life, and share all my life's troubles--you would desert me now--desert me in
this hour?--and I very much fear, not the worst in store for us?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, no, George; it's not that--not that! But you know how we
have feared him and have trembled for years--and now I should----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">If you can't even do that----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">If necessary--yes I--I will do it.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then--as soon as he returns. [<span class="sc2"> Brauer </span><i>
is heard breathing heavily</i>.] Ah, here he is!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Enters</i>.] Why, that is almost an old-time Biblical
miracle. Just think, children, think of it---- But where is Gertrude? Well?
Can't you speak?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Trembling</i>.] I think she is dressing!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Well, it will interest you also, so listen: I met the
assistant pastor as he came from the house here, and he told me, rather piqued,
that our good old pastor had suddenly risen from his bed and limpingly insisted
upon delivering the wedding discourse himself. Well--what's the matter? Aren't
you glad?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">H'm----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Of course, you are a perfect heathen! But I say, our assistant
pastor must have been terribly put out. He had been preparing for that same
address for days. He looked rather crestfallen; but then, there is no help for
it.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Pardon me, uncle; in order to save time, I must ask you for an
interview.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">What, again? Can't you wait till afternoon?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">No! Before the ceremony, if you please.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Startled</i>.] Wha--oh, I see. I suppose now you will
demand more than I am willing to give? Marie, leave us [<span class="sc2">Paul </span><i>enters</i>.]
Well, what now?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Gives him a sign</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">There, look at him! Well, have you lost your tongue, man? Why
don't you speak?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, no, Mr. Brauer, I have something to say to you--alone.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then why don't you come nearer?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Whispering</i>.] We have just now caught the old woman.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>With a glance at </i><span class="sc2">Marie</span>.] What?
Marie, you may remain and chat with George for awhile; he is a very interesting
young man. [<i>Softly, to </i><span class="sc2">Paul</span>.] Where?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">Down in the cellar; just as I wanted to put the beer on the
ice, I found her there in a dark corner, loaded down with plunder!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Is she there now?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, struggling like a demon.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Undoubtedly this offense will earn her a good long term in
prison and we will be rid of her for a long time! But how to get her out of the
house?</p>
<br>
<h3>Paul.</h3>

<p class="normal">Leave that to me Mr. Brauer; I know a way to keep her quiet.</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, yes, and in the meantime I will make out the papers and
we will hand her over to the Gendarme; that will be the best. Children, I will
be busy for a moment! Wait here until I return.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Don't forget, uncle!</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">No, no. I'll be back in a moment. Come, Mr. Paul!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Both exit</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">You are trembling----</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Am I?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Marie dear, I am with you. No one shall harm you!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, it is not that.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">What, then?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, I don't know. It has suddenly come over me so---- [<i>Starts</i>.]
Sh! He's coming! [<i>Noise. Scuffling of feet and smothered cries are heard</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">What is it?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">In God's name, be still!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gypsy.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Calling for help</i>.] Mine daughter! Mine Mamie! My
Mamie!!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Hear? Hear? <i>My mother</i>! They are taking her away--to
prison! Sh! Be still! No, no; don't open the door! Be quiet! Be quiet!</p>
<br>
<h3>Gypsy.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Not as loud as before</i>.] Oh, mine daughter! My
Mamie--my Mamie----! [<i>Dying out</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Will you not go out to her, no matter what she has done?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">How can I? How can I? I am afraid--afraid----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Then shall I go?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Frightened</i>.] No, no; don't leave me!! Sh! Be quiet!
So, quiet! Now they have gone! Thank heaven! [<i>Again wailing, but very distant</i>.]
Hear? Hear? Let her shriek! Let her call! I cannot help her! I am a thief, the
same as she. I, too, have come to this house, and I have stolen. But oh, my God,
what have I stolen? What have I stolen?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Come, Marie, control yourself! Think of what we have before
us!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, yes--I'll be quiet! What have we before us? No, no; I
will not--I cannot--I----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Do you mean to----</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>In door</i>.] Did you hear anything, children? Any noise?</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">We heard screams and a scuffle. What was the matter?</p>
<br>
<h3>Brauer.</h3>

<p class="normal">Oh, nothing of any consequence. Don't mind it. An old vagabond
of a woman, that's all. I have only to sign the papers now, then I'll be back. [<i>Exit</i>.]</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal"><i>Marie</i>!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Hush, not a word, not a word! She out there must go her way,
and I must go mine!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">What do you mean?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">You said it yourself. 'Tis madness! Yes, yes; 'tis madness!
<i>All</i>--<i>all</i>! What we do--what we desire--all--all!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">Marie!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Or do you imagine for one moment we could be happy together?
No, I know you too well. I know the certain result. You would never forgive
yourself nor me, and in the end life would become a burden to me, if only
because I was in your way. Yes, yes, that would be the end of it all----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal"><i>Marie</i>, I will be faithful to you forever, let come what
may, be it good or bad; you know that!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Yes, thank God!--yes!</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">If there was only the slightest possibility of a chance to
escape from all this whirl--then we might be free, we might---- But no matter
what we begin, we cannot shake off nor disregard our obligations to this house;
never, as long as we live!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Therefore, what more can you desire? Everything on earth we
possess, all that was beautiful, all the love, all--all, we gave to each other.
There is nothing more to give, for either one of us. St. John's night is past,
the fires are out, are dead----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">And what shall become of us?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Of you? That I can't tell. Perhaps you will be happy, perhaps
not; that must all rest with yourself. And I? Oh, be content. I will take care
of myself. As soon as possible I shall leave this house. Not to-day, as I would
like--it might create suspicion----</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">And where will you go?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Ah, the world is large. I shall go far, far away, where no one
will ever find me. No, no, not even you, George.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">And if you should go to ruin out there?</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">Do not fear. I am the calamity child, the foundling. My hands
are hard and callous--see, see! Just like my heart is, now. I will work and
work, and toil, until I fall exhausted--then I will sleep and rest, until it is
time for work again; and thus I will perhaps maintain a miserable existence.</p>
<br>
<h3>George.</h3>

<p class="normal">You say you are a calamity child! Well, so am I. But our
accounts do not harmonize. You are going out into the world and misery, and it
was I who drove you to it. Even did I not love you as I do, that thought would
follow me forever and embitter my entire life. But, be it so. We are both
children of misery! Therefore let us grit our teeth, shake each other by the
hand--and say farewell!</p>
<br>
<h3>Marie.</h3>

<p class="normal">[<i>Softly</i>.] Good-bye, Georgie dear--and--don't be
afraid--he is not yet coming--and forgive me--do you hear? From to-day--you
understand? Did I not love you as much as I do, this would not have been quite
so hard; but there--there--'tis all right now--I know; I can never be entirely
poor now; for once, at least, the fires of St. John have burned for
me--once--just once----</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Enters</i>.] So there, I am ready to go! But, that is, you

<p class="normal">And what did he say?</p>
